# ~flix or tildeflix

### A personal flix service for your videos

Serves common video formats over HTTP(S) so that you can access them from wherever there's internetz.
Simple web interface included, looks nice on your tablet :)

- Generates thumbnails on the fly
- Has searchable front page
- Very much a WIP
